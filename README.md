# Module 1 evaluation - Adalab Bootcamp 

This website is developed thanks to the knowledge acquired after receiving the lessons of module 1 of Adalab. It is intended for teachers to be able to evaluate whether I have met the necessary requirements, and also for me, to check my progress and see how I have performed putting into practice all the skills obtained from HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Git and task automation.
